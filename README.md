### Description

Envision 2d Engine BETA 2:<br>

Heaps of easy to use graphics functions

<br><br>

-Animation in one line.<br>

-Easy sprite in one line.<br>

-Screenshots: Incremental file names.<br>

-ZOrder: Drawing objects in order.<br>

-Tiling: Some function incomplete<br>

<hr>

Existing Functions: blending (by percentage), rotating, copying using a colourkey, creating masks, printing text with border/bg, and printing a custom bitmapped font. It also includes the "Envision" engine which has a few functions: validating paths, easy FPS counter, nice "stopwatch" style timer. To it use simply compile to a DLL and add a reference to it in your app. This app is a prelude to a pure VB 3D engine I am planning on. The engine will be based on the code I've already posted here - so have a look at my previous submissions I've spent a while on this so any feedback positive or negative (preferably positive) would be appretiated.

<br><br>PLEASE PLEASE vote!
