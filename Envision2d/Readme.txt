Some things to note: When a sprite is added to an animation
or ZOrder object it will be COPIED, as opposed to adding 
that object. Therefore changing the original sprite will not
modify the one in the animation/ZOrder
-------------------------------------------------------
UPCOMING:
	*Loading HDC's (ie into memory, not a picture box)
	Rotation Fix
	Key press detection
	Tiling: Transparent tiles, being able to tile
		from a point (not from 0,0 corner)
	ZOrder: Possible implementation of Quick sort/
		multiple sorting algorithms. Fixing
		GetElement and SetElement.
	Genral Optimisation
	Any Suggestions?

BETA 2:	12/12/2001
	Animation
	Sprite
	Screenshots
	ZOrder (GetElement/SetElement are not working
		any suggestions would be welcome)
	TileSet partly implemented, still needs some work

BETA 1:	11/12/2001
	Blending by Percentage
	Rotating (work needed)
	Creating Masks
	ColourKeys
	Writing with border/background
	Bitmapped Fonts

This engine will provide you with some simple 2d functions.
It is in early BETA stage so any bugs etc please e-mail me
----------------------------------------------------------
The Envision engine contains some functions - mainly path
and directory detection as well as a timer and FPS counter

The TEST folders for both engines contain a sample app 
showing all working features.

These are a prelude to my next project: Envision3D a pure
VB 3d engine. Most of the functioning 3D code for this can 
be seen in my other submissions to PSC. It will feature: 
	2d sprites with masking
	FLAT filled 3d faced (no texures/ shading)
	backface removal
	ambient/point lighting
	face material properties (ie, shiny, dull)
	painters algorithm to place faces in order

	and all kinds of fun stuff.
